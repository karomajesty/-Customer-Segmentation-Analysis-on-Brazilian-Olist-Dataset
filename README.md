# -Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-on-Brazilian-Olist-Dataset
A data-driven RFM segmentation revealing customer behavior, loyalty patterns, and strategic insights for e-commerce growth.
#
## üß† Overview

This project applies the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to segment customers from the Brazilian Olist e-commerce platform. By analyzing purchasing behavior, product preferences, and geographic trends, the project uncovers actionable insights to drive retention, loyalty, and strategic growth.

## üß™ Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading & Merging  
- Imported five datasets: orders, customers, items, products, and category translations  
- Merged them into a unified DataFrame for holistic customer analysis

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Converted timestamps to datetime format  
- Checked and handled missing values  
- Calculated total revenue per order

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ RFM Metric Calculation  
- Defined a snapshot date (one day after the last purchase)  
- Computed:
  - **Recency**: Days since last purchase  
  - **Frequency**: Number of orders  
  - **Monetary**: Total spend

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualized distributions of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary  
- Identified skewness, outliers, and behavioral patterns

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Segmentation  
- Assigned RFM scores using quintiles  
- Mapped score combinations to intuitive segments:
  - Champions
  - Loyal Customers
  - Potential Loyalists
  - New Customers
  - At Risk
  - Lost Customers
  - Others

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Segment Profiling  
- Compared average RFM metrics across segments  
- Visualized segment proportions, profiles, and behavioral clusters

## üí° Strategic Insights

### Segment Behavior
- **Champions**: Recent, frequent, high spenders‚Äîideal for loyalty programs  
- **At Risk**: High historical spend but poor recency‚Äîprime for reactivation  
- **Lost Customers**: Long inactive, low value‚Äîtarget with win-back campaigns  
- **New Customers**: Recent but infrequent‚Äîneed onboarding and nurturing  
- **Potential Loyalists**: Moderate scores‚Äîready for upselling

### Product Preferences
- Champions and Loyal Customers favor home and wellness categories  
- Lost Customers previously bought similar items‚Äîsuggesting re-engagement potential  
- New Customers explore entry-level categories‚Äîideal for introductory promotions  
- Potential Loyalists lean toward productivity-related products

### Geographic Trends
- Lost Customers cluster in S√£o Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), and Minas Gerais (MG)  
- Champions are geographically diverse‚Äîvalue exists beyond urban centers  
- Regional segmentation supports localized marketing and inventory planning

### Behavioral Trends
- Segment sizes fluctuate monthly  
- Promotions drive spikes in New Customers  
- Engagement drops correlate with churn

## üéØ Recommendations

- **Retention Focus**: Prioritize At Risk and Potential Loyalists with personalized offers  
- **Loyalty Programs**: Reward Champions to maintain engagement  
- **Win-Back Campaigns**: Target Lost Customers in SP, RJ, and MG  
- **Product Strategy**: Align inventory with segment-specific preferences  
- **Regional Marketing**: Customize outreach based on geographic insights

## How to Run the Project (Local Setup)

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash  
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-repo-name.git  
    cd your-repo-name
2. Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install the required libraries:
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
4. Download the dataset: (If the dataset is too large to include in the repo, provide instructions or a link to where it can be downloaded, e.g., Kaggle.) You can download the Olist E-commerce Public Dataset from Kaggle. Place the unzipped CSV files into a data/ directory within your project.
5. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
  jupyter notebook "Customer segmentation analysis on brazilian Olist dataset - Jupyter Notebook.ipynb"
This will open the notebook in your web browser, where you can execute the cells to see the analysis.
